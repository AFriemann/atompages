title: First page


# Hi there!

This is your first page! 

## Creating new new pages
You can create new pages by simply creating "<name>.md" files in your ``source/pages`` directory. 

If you're using the development script, you will see your page updating as you save your content. Magic!

## Creating menus
Folders will automatically be used to create a menu for you, using the same structure.

## Writing content for different languages
You can create content for different languages simply by renaming your files or folders and prepending a language prefix (like "en_" or "de_")

## More configuration
You can adapt some of the configuration by editing the ``options.json`` file in the root of your project folder
